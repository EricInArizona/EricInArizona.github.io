<br>

<p>I write software for Windows and for Android
 apps. I write software with the C++, C# and Java
 programming languages.
</p>

<p>One of the projects I am working on is for
 Math and Graphics.  It is for everything from
 vectors to tensors.  It is related to Fluid
 Dynamics, Climate Modeling, and General 
 Relativity.
</p>

<p>Another project I am working on is for 
 cryptography.  I am working on factoring large
 numbers for the RSA cryptosystem, and also I am
 working on Elliptic Curve cryptography in order
 to learn how hard it would be to break the
 Bitcoin algorithms.  Breaking that cryptosystem
 would make Bitcoin worthless.  So it's
 interesting to understand if it can
 be done or not.
