<h1>Eric Chauvin</h1>

<p>I write software with the C++, C# and Java
 programming languages.
</p>

<p>I have the basic RSA crypto system working
 so that it tests all of the basic integer
 math functions.  I'm just starting on the 
 elliptic curve things for the ECDSA (Elliptic
 Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) which is
 used in Bitcoin and other things.  The other
 projects besides cryptography are still all
 just very preliminary stuff.
