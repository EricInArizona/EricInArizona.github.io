<p>This project is about basic graphics
 and the math needed for graphics, but also much
 more. It is about the math for vectors,
 quaternions, tensors and other things.
 It makes it so those mathematical ideas can
 be visualized.  If you are reading books about
 vectors, matrices and tensors, this source
 code shows examples of how they are used.  It's
 not meant to replace those books.
</p>

<p>In relativity, there is the main idea of
 an observer.  The observer defines a frame
 of reference.  Einstein wrote about how an
 observer could be sitting in a moving train,
 and that person in the moving train was a
 frame of reference.  They saw the world from
 their point of view in a moving train.
</p>

<p>In graphics programming there is the idea
 of a Camera Position, which sets up a frame
 of reference.  The camera points in a certain
 direction, so looking at the world from
 that camera position is the same idea of an
 observer and their frame of reference.  So it's
 possible to visualize what things look like in
 3D graphics from that observer's point of view.
</p>

<p>The camera is a single point, like a
 pin-hole camera.  It's like the pupil of your
 eye.  So it has a set of coordinates for the
 point where the eye is.  It has a LookAt vector
 which points toward where the observer is
 looking, and it has an Up vector which tells you
 which was is up.  The cross product of the
 LookAt and Up vectors gives you a third vector,
 so those three vectors give you the basis
 vectors for a 3D coordinate system.  That
 defines the reference frame of the observer.
</p>

<p>In 3D graphics it is common to do the math
 on the graphics processor with Homogeneous
 Coordinates, also known as Projective Coordinates.
 The four coordinates x, y, z, and w, are used
 to project 3D coordinates on to a two dimensional
 display.  The Vector4EC.java source code file
 shows how to do operations with those vectors.
</p>

<p>A second observer holding their own camera
 has their own frame of reference, and you can
 use Matrix Transformations to translate
 something in the language of your reference frame
 in to their reference frame.  Or to put it
 another way, you can see things in 3D graphics
 from another person's point of view.  The
 Matrix4EC.java file shows how to do those
 transformations with a transformation matrix.
