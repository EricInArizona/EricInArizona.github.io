<p>In cryptography large integers are fundamental,
 so you should start with the Base10Number.cpp,
 Integer.cpp, and IntegerMath.cpp files, in that
 order, first.
</p>

<p>Look at MainApp.cpp to see what is current.
 It has the mainLoop() function and you can follow
 it from there.  The main() function in main.cpp
 just creates and runs the MainApp.cpp object.
 Everything except the main() function is
 written with C++ objects, not in C.
</p>

<p>GitHub sorts files in ASCII order.  So lower
 case letters come after all upper case letters.
 The file main.cpp, which starts with a lower
 case letter is at the very bottom because
 pretty much all other files start with upper
 case letters.  And RSA.h sorts above the
 RandomCrypto.h file because of the capital S
 in RSA.
