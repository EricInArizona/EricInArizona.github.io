<p>This project is about math and graphics,
 but also much more. It is about the math for
 vectors, quaternions, tensors and other things.
 It makes it so those mathematical ideas can
 be visualized with 3D graphics.  If you are
 reading books about these subjects, this source
 code shows examples of how they are used.  It's
 not meant to replace those books.

<p>More to come...
