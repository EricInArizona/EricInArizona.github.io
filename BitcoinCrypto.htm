The price of Bitcoin in US Dollars.</a>
</p>

<p>Bitcoin is all about Cryptography and the
 technical details of programming for it, but 
 some of the ideas about Bitcoin are based on
 Game Theory and the incentives that people
 have.  So, like any other form of Economics it
 is based on people's behavior.
 Something is valuable because people believe
 it is valuable.  People will pay for something
 because it has value to them.  For example
 Beauty has value to many women and so the
 company L'Oreal is valued at about
 163 billion dollars.
</p>

<p>Bitcoin has value because people believe it
 has value.  They will pay for it.
</p>

<p>The market cap for Bitcoin would be the price
 of one Bitcoin times the number of Bitcoins,
 and it's something like a Trillion dollars.
 If the main encrytion algorithm that Bitcoin
 is based on could be broken then Bitcoin would
 be worthless, and that Trillion dollars in
 Bitcoin would suddenly become worth zero.
</p>

<p>The maximum number of Bitcoins is based on
 the algorithms currently used.  Those algorithms
 are agreed to by human beings.  They can change
 those agreements.  So even though it's not
 impossible that the algorithms can be changed,
 the way it is now, the maximum number of
 Bitcoins is about 21 million.  That's the
 theoretical maximum, but some people have
 lost their private keys, or they died or
 something, and so those Bitcoins are lost.
 Once a person loses their private key, the
 Bitcoin associated with that private key is
 not spendable.  It becomes worthless. The
 private key, the encryption key, is what
 actually has value.
</p>

<p>If you think of the private key as a password,
 then your password to your online bank account
 is what has value. If a hacker gets the password
 to your bank account, then they can have your
 bank account.  But unlike with a real bank
 account, if you lose your Bitcoin private key,
 your bank account disappears.  It just vanishes
 in to thin air. And you can't go talk to a
 banker at the bank and get your money.  It's
 just gone.  What had value is just gone.
</p>

<p>There was a contest called the RSA Factoring
 Challenge, which was a contest with prizes up
 to 200,000 dollars, to get people to try and
 break the RSA CryptoSystem.  But that contest
 actually goes back to an article in Scientific
 American in 1977, by Martin Gardner, called
 "A new kind of cipher that would take millions
 of years to break".  And it involved a 100 dollar
 prize.
</p>

<p>Now days there is a bigger contest, with
 bigger prizes.  Like the Trillion dollar prize
 that some well funded hacker could win by
 stealing Bitcoins.  So Edgar Allan Poe would
 have said about Bitcoin: "Yet it may be roundly
 asserted that human ingenuity cannot concoct
 a cipher which human ingenuity cannot resolve."
</p>

<p>Especially with a Trillion dollar prize to
 be won.
</p>

<p>The question is: Can human ingenuity come
 up with a way to get the private key?  Could
 a hacker find the private key?  That is what
 I am trying to do.  But very publicly.  Not in
 secret, like a thief, but more like saying that
 the Emperor is not wearing any clothes. I am
 trying to demonstrate that a private key can
 be found.
